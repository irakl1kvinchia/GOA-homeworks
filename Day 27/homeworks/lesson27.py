# an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed

# N2

# Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.
# If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours!
# Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...
