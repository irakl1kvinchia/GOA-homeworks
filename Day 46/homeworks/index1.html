        <p>Educational architecture, school architecture or 
            school building design is a discipline which practices 
            architect and others for the design of educational 
            institutions, such as schools and universities, 
            as well as other choices in the educational design 
            of learning experiences. The design of building can 
            significantly influence the learning experience of students. 
            Additionally, because schools are important sources of traffic, 
            employment and community activities, 
            school buildings often act as anchor institutions in 
            neighborhoods or communities.
            The decline of a school can have significant impact on local communities.</p>
