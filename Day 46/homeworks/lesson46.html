        <p>A school is both the <a href="index.html"> educational institution </a>
            and <a href="index1.html"> building </a> designed to provide learning spaces and 
            learning environments for the teaching of students 
            under the direction of <a href="index2.html"> teachers </a>. Most countries have 
            systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory. 
            In these systems, students progress through a series of schools 
            that can be built and operated by both government and private organization. 
            The names for these schools vary by country
            (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally 
            include primary school for young children and secondary school for 
            teenagers who have completed primary education. 
            An institution where higher education is taught is commonly 
            called a university college or university.</p>
