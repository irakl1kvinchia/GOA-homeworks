# Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

# For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out,
#  because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

# Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625
# because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

# Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

# Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.
