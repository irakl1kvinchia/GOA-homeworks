    <h2 style="text-align: center;">general-purpose programming languages</h2>
    <p>In computer software, a general-purpose programming language 
        (GPL) is a programming language for building software in a 
        wide variety of application domains. Conversely, a domain-specific 
        programming language (DSL) is used within a specific area. 
        For example, Python is a GPL, while SQL is a DSL for querying relational databases.</p>
