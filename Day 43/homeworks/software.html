    <h2 style="text-align: center;">computer software</h2>
    <p> <b>Software </b> is a collection of programs and data 
        that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks. 
        Software often includes associated software documentation. 
        This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is 
        built and which actually performs the work.</p>
