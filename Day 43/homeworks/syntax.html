    <h2 style="text-align: center;">syntax</h2>
    <p>In computer science, the syntax of a computer language is 
        the rules that define the combinations of symbols 
        that are considered to be correctly structured statements or
        expressions in that language. This applies both to programming languages, 
        where the document represents source code, and to markup languages, 
        where the document represents data.</p>
